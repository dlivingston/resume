## Summary
I am a Senior Web and User Interface (UI/UX) Developer. I have over 12 years of experience working with a broad range of companies and clients. I focus on producing clean, readable, maintainable code, as well as attractive and usable web designs. My personal aptitude is in balancing the "right-brained" creative concerns of User Interface Design with the "left-brained" logical and analytic discipline of Development.
