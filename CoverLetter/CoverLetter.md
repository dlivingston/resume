Dear Hiring Team,

I’m a Senior Front-End Web and UI Developer with over 12 years of experience creating responsive, performant, and user-focused digital experiences. I’m excited by your mission to redefine how people interact with AI and the opportunity to help shape that experience as a founding frontend engineer.

My career has focused on building intuitive interfaces with React, TypeScript, and modern tools like Next.js, all while collaborating closely with design and product teams. I bring a strong background in UI/UX design principles, accessibility, and component architecture—skills I’ve applied in both large-scale systems and rapid prototyping environments. I'm also deeply familiar with integrating frontend apps with RESTful APIs and GraphQL backends.

What draws me to this opportunity is the chance to contribute to a team that values clean, maintainable code and thoughtful user experience at the ground level. I thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments and would love to help bring your platform to life.

Thank you for considering my application. You can find work samples, a brief intro video, and more about me through the links below.

Best regards,
Donald Livingston
