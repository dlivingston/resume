Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer, Core UI position at Lattice. With over 12 years of experience in software engineering, I have developed a strong expertise in building and maintaining high-performance applications using modern frameworks such as React, Relay, and Next.js. My focus on creating cohesive and accessible user experiences aligns perfectly with Lattice's mission to build a people success platform.

In my previous roles, I have successfully architected and maintained design systems that facilitate collaboration across engineering, product, and design teams. I am passionate about developing reusable front-end components that promote consistency and efficiency throughout the product suite. Additionally, I have a track record of mentoring junior engineers and advocating for best practices in accessibility and clean code.

I am particularly drawn to Lattice because of your commitment to creating a people-centric culture, and I am eager to contribute my skills to enhance the overall product experience. I am excited about the opportunity to work closely with a collaborative team and to play a role in minimizing redundancy while accelerating development processes.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to the ongoing success of the Core UI team at Lattice.

Best Wishes,

Donald Livingston
