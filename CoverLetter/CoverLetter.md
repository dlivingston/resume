Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a Senior Front-End Web and UI Developer with over 12 years of experience building fast, accessible, and visually compelling web applications. I specialize in creating clean, maintainable code and intuitive user experiences—always with an eye toward performance, SEO, and responsive design.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked with modern frameworks like React and Vue, implemented testing strategies across multiple layers (unit, integration, functional), and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable front-end solutions. My approach bridges the creative and analytical—blending design sensibility with engineering discipline to produce cohesive digital experiences.

The opportunity at Nuna caught my attention because it aligns closely with both my technical skill set and my passion for high-quality, user-centered development. I’d welcome the chance to contribute to your team and support Nuna’s growth as a premium global brand.

Thank you for considering my application. I invite you to review my portfolio and other materials linked below, and I look forward to the possibility of speaking further.

Best regards,
Donald Livingston
