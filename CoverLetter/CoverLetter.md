Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to apply for the Senior Principal UI Developer role with Oracle Health. With over 12 years of experience building large-scale, enterprise web applications, my focus has been on designing frontend systems that prioritize performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability—particularly in environments where reliability and correctness are critical.

In my recent roles, I’ve operated as a senior individual contributor and UI architect, responsible for setting frontend standards, defining shared patterns, and building the structural foundations that enable teams to move quickly without sacrificing quality. I bring deep hands-on experience with TypeScript, React, and modern frontend tooling, and I’ve partnered closely with UX, backend, and platform teams to translate complex requirements into intuitive, scalable interfaces. Mentorship, code quality, and architectural rigor have been core parts of my day-to-day work.

What draws me to Oracle Health is the opportunity to modernize the EHR experience with human-centered design, disciplined UI engineering, and emerging technologies like generative AI. I’m motivated by work where frontend rigor has real-world impact, and I’d welcome the opportunity to help shape standards and systems that support safe, scalable innovation in healthcare. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Donald Livingston
