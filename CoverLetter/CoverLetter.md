Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Application Developer position with Dow Jones. With over 12 years of experience in front-end development and user experience design, I specialize in building clean, maintainable code and intuitive, visually engaging interfaces. I balance creativity with technical precision - a skillset well suited for innovative storytelling and newsroom applications.

While I have not worked directly in a newsroom, I bring extensive experience thriving under high-pressure, deadline-driven conditions. For example, as a consultant with MRM//McCann, I collaborated with designers, marketers, and project managers to deliver digital campaigns on accelerated timelines, requiring rapid prototyping, iteration, and cross-disciplinary communication. Similarly, in roles across e-commerce and healthcare, I have partnered closely with designers, product owners, and engineering teams to create interactive tools that support both business goals and user needs.

My technical expertise includes foundational web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, along with modern frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express.js, and build tools including Webpack and Gulp. I am also experienced with API integration, analytics, cross-device development, and UI/UX design principles — all critical for building and maintaining newsroom applications that are performant, scalable, and easy to use. I’m adept at translating complex needs into usable digital tools — skills I believe will serve reporters, editors, and visual journalists well. 

I would welcome the opportunity to bring this blend of technical and creative problem-solving to Dow Jones’ Storytelling and Visuals team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience can contribute to your team’s innovative work.

Best regards,  
Donald Livingston
