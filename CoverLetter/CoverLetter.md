Dear Hiring Manager,

Greetings! I am a Senior Web and User Interface (UI/UX) Developer with over 12 years of experience, and I am excited to apply for the Senior Staff Software Engineer position at Cribl. I focus on producing clean, readable, and maintainable code, as well as designing attractive and usable web applications. My personal aptitude lies in balancing the "right-brained" creative aspects of User Interface Design with the "left-brained" logical and analytical discipline of Development.

Having built engaging web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, I am confident in my ability to design and develop delightful user interfaces that integrate cutting-edge AI technologies. I have extensive experience in creating solutions that address real customer problems, and I thrive in collaborative environments that prioritize putting customers first. I share Cribl's commitment to fostering a dynamic workplace where team members can enjoy their work while delivering exceptional results.

I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to review my skills and experience. You can view examples of my work in my portfolio and the links provided below. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience with you in greater detail.

Best Wishes,
Donald Livingston
