Dear Hiring Team at KoBold,

As a Senior Web and User Interface Developer with over 12 years of experience, I bring a passion for intuitive, performant, and scalable front-end solutions. My background bridges the creative demands of UI/UX design with the logical rigor of engineering—an ideal match for KoBold’s mission to empower scientists through impactful software tools.

I’m particularly excited by the opportunity to build advanced data visualization and geospatial tools for a company that is both innovating in AI and contributing to critical industries like clean energy and infrastructure. My work has included building complex front-end architectures using TypeScript, React, and modern visualization libraries like AG Grid and D3. I’ve also collaborated closely with scientists, analysts, and product teams to turn raw data into meaningful visual narratives—skills I see as directly aligned with KoBold’s work at the intersection of geoscience and technology.

You’ll find that I take pride in writing maintainable, well-tested code, setting up component libraries for design consistency, and working across functions to ensure UI performance, accessibility, and clarity. I’m also quick to ramp up in new domains and excited to learn from domain experts—especially in an environment as unique as yours.

Thank you for considering my application. I’ve included links to my portfolio and additional materials below. I’d welcome the chance to speak further and learn how I can contribute to KoBold’s cutting-edge exploration work.

Best regards,
Donald Livingston
