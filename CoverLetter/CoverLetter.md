Dear Hiring Manager,  

Greetings! I am a Senior Web and User Interface (UI/UX) Developer with over 12 years of experience. I focus on producing clean, readable, maintainable code, as well as attractive and usable web designs. My personal aptitude is in balancing the "right-brained" creative concerns of User Interface Design with the "left-brained" logical and analytic discipline of Development.  

I am confident that my skills and experience in Front-End web technologies and frameworks will be a valuable addition to your team. I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to review my skills and experience. You can view examples of my work in my portfolio and the links provided below.  

I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience with you in greater detail.  

Best Wishes,  
Donald Livingston
