Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Staff Web Engineer position on the UI Foundation team at Airbnb. With over 12 years of experience in web engineering, I have developed a strong expertise in building high-performance, accessible, and scalable frontend solutions using JavaScript and TypeScript, particularly with React.

My experience includes architecting design systems that empower product teams to deliver premium-quality user interfaces. I have a deep understanding of motion animation development and have successfully collaborated with cross-platform teams to create reusable UI infrastructure that enhances engineering efficiency. My approach is always design-centric, ensuring that every solution aligns with both user experience and technical excellence.

I am excited about the opportunity to work closely with world-class engineers and designers at Airbnb to influence UI engineering practices on a broader scale. I thrive in collaborative environments and look forward to contributing to new product initiatives while supporting the Airbnb Web community.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the ongoing success of the UI Foundation team.

Best Wishes,

Donald Livingston
