Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a senior frontend engineer with 12+ years of experience building and owning scalable, user-centered web applications across product, enterprise, and consulting environments. My work focuses on frontend architecture, accessibility, and performance — delivering UI systems that are clear, maintainable, and built to evolve over time.

I specialize in owning frontend work end to end: partnering with design and product, setting standards and structure, and translating requirements into high-quality interfaces using modern frontend technologies. I’ve worked extensively with React, TypeScript, Angular, and Vue, and I’m comfortable operating in complex, cross-functional environments where judgment and clarity matter.

I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute that experience to your team. Examples of my work, along with additional background, can be found in my portfolio and links below. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Donald Livingston
